==================
Installation
------------------

Include notify.css and jquery.notify.js in your HTML. You'll also need,
jquery-1.3.2.js (or latest jquery 1.3 release) and jquery.jcorners.js.

You can get jquery.jcorners.js from:
http://plugins.jquery.com/project/JCorners


==================
Usage
------------------

You can then create notifications by calling $.notify(options), where
options is an object with some or all or the attributes: title, text, icon,
and delay (in millisecs).

Example: $.notify({title:'Example', text:'Lorem ipsum...', icon:'image.png'});


==================
Supported Browsers
------------------

Tested and working on:
    
    FF3 (Windows XP & Ubuntu)
    IE7
    IE6
    Safari 3.2.1 (Windows XP)
    Opera 10.0 (Windows XP)

Additional testing would be welcome, if you have any more results
to add please get in touch.


==================
Known Issues
------------------

Browser security error if opened as a local file instead of run through a
webserver. Most other issues are due to ongoing development on handling 
CSS for elements behind the notifications. Active and focus CSS properties
are not currently supported, and hover styles are only partially supported.

If you have any problems, please submit an Issue on GitHub.
