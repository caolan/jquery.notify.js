==================
Installation
------------------

Include notify.css and jquery.notify.js in your HTML. You'll also need,
jquery-1.3.2.js (or latest jquery 1.3 release) and jquery.jcorners.js.

You can get jquery.jcorners.js from:
http://plugins.jquery.com/project/JCorners


==================
Usage
------------------

You can then create notifications by calling $.notify(options), where
options is an object with some or all or the attributes: title, text, icon,
and delay (in millisecs).

Example: $.notify({title:'Example', text:'Lorem ipsum...', icon:'image.png'});


==================
Supported Browsers
------------------

Tested and working on FF3 (Windows XP & Ubuntu), IE7, IE6


==================
Known Issues
------------------

Opera:              no rounded corners support
Firefox 2.x:        does not implement getBoundingClientRect, breaks on hover
Safari on Windows:  no fade out on hover, click through works however
                    (Safari on Mac not tested)

If you fancy tackling any of these or testing some more browsers I'd
appreciate the help ;) You can fork the project on github or contact me with
your patches or test results.
